## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The portion that took the longest was the styling, setting up supabase was very straight forward after I looked into in a little. Once I have the database set up then I worked on inputting the correct information, which also took a large amount of time due to some small errors in syntax that I had. Currently the only portion that is lacking is the update feature. I want to have the current information stored at that id to be displayed in the text boxes, allowing the user to see that they are changing the correct value, but was unable to get it working at this time.
